Last week I watched a film named *Million Dollar Baby*, which won the Oscar for Best  Motion Picture. It's a story about a woman named Maggie dedicated herself to practicing boxing skill, with the help of her trainer, she grew from clumsy combatant to potential champion. In the last match, because of the opponent, who fights dirty, didn't obey boxing rules and hint her three times in the face when a round ended, she injured severely and became paralyzed, with no hope of recovery. I don't aim to emphasize the enthusiasm she showed in boxing, on another hand, I saw when rules are broken, how to protect ourselves from rule - breakers.

### Why rules could be broken?

In the movie, Maggie was attacked by the opponent when a round ended, at that time, she was careless of attacking because the boxing rules stipulated that boxers must stop attack when a round ended. The opponent was dare to against the rule because the price for punishment is negligible compared to bonus for winning the game.
Like Karl Marx mentioned in *Das Capital*, if there are 50% of the profits, capital could be desperate to do it; for 100% of the profits, capital dared to trample all human law; for 300% of the profits, capital would dare to commit any crime, or even take the risk of being beheaded. A million dollar for the champion is a tantalizing bonus for competitors, it may cause someone regardless of boxing rules.
### What can we do?

Although trainer Frankie emphasizes the principle over and over in the film:"Always protect yourself", it's hard to always be aware of this principle in stinging competition. Technically, Maggie could hold fists ahead of face to prevent the opponent's attack, but when a round ends, she subliminally canceled protection in terms of boxing rules, which led to suffer from the opponent. The first time she attacked by the opponent, she should realize this is an opponent could waive the rule and be wary of her all the time during the game. If she could learn from the mistake and protect herself briefly, the result may have been different.
In real life, obviously there are unfair situations and rule-breakers that we may faced, we need to learn from mistakes and try to avoid it next time, and deal with these nuisances.
