I've never been to Italy, thought this is the country I'm dreaming of traveling to. Lately I have listened to some audios introducing the travel to Italy and Italian's characteristics, moreover,  I'm enchanted by some books about the Renaissance, which describe how the Renaissance originated from Italy.

### Origin of the Renaissance
The Renaissance began as a cultural movement in Florence in Medieval period and subsequently spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Modern age. An important reason of why the Renaissance began in Florence is that the Medici family's effort of  stimulating the art. The leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo DA Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti, couldn't forge ahead with art works without the patronage of the Medici. The humanism, which derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas holding the opinion of "Man is the measure of all things", became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature.

As a prosperous family, the Medici used their money to stipulate the development of culture, art and science, which made an outstanding contribution to subsequent generations, other than only left wealth to offspring. Their influence on world will live forever.
###  Sightseeing
There are two destinations in Italy I'm keen on.

Cradle of the Renaissance, romantic, enchanting and utterly irresistible, Florence is a place to feast on world-class art. Unsurprisingly, the entire city center is a Unesco World Heritage site. 
![Cinque Terre](https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tKfTcgy1fkhp1p4rbaj31jk111n9w.jpg)
Cinque Terre consists of five ingeniously constructed fishing villages, which show splendid lights at night. Sinuous paths traverse seemingly impregnable cliffsides, while a 19th-century railway line cut through a series of coastal tunnels ferries the footsore from village to village. 

### Characteristics of Italian
From an audio by Wu Jun<sup>(1)</sup>, I gained some characteristics of Italian. First, they are pround of their hometown, there's a saying "Bells from every street's church worth treasuring". Besides, they love to relax and socialize, so it's easy to make friends with them. Nevertheless, sometimes they are indolent. This is mainly because socialism and egalitarianism prevail, they won't gain too much reward for diligence.

That's my impression of Italy, the fascinating country I'm looking forward to visiting.
