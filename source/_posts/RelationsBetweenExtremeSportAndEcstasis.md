Extreme sport becomes more and more popular among young guys nowadays. Some people treat it as a way of livelihood, some as an exciting lifestyle. Although peril exists in extreme sport and some people pay a high price for it, it's still attractive to many people. A Chinese proverb says that "The boundless scenery is at the perilous peak" shows why people pursue the places where almost nobody can reach. Ecstasis is a psychological state where a person is fully immersed and focused on an activity or task. There may be relations between extreme sport and ecstasis.
A movie named "Point Break" shows eight extreme sports, from my not professional view, is a fascinating introduction to the extreme sport. For example, wearing a wingsuit and flying between mountains, climbing a mountain without protection. When watching this movie, I was inspired by their bravery to conquer physical detriment. Perhaps only these sports could give them feelings of accomplishment.

Hans Ludwig, who was named "Best Female Extreme Skier in the World", had five near-death experiences in skiing. Because whenever she felt that level of fear, that's when she felt the most alive, and she was addicted to that feeling. Ecstasis emerge from her near-death experience, but it's always sophisticated enough to calculate whether the outcome outweighs the risk.
In the book "Stealing Fire", Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal define the ecstasis in four parts:
- Selflessness: In nonordinary states, dopamine often skyrockets, while activity in the prefrontal cortex plummets. Suddenly we’re finding connections between ideas that we’ve never even thought of before.
- Timelessness: Our ability to accurately estimate how close things are to happening, both in our lives and in the world at large, can get seriously skewed.
- Effortlessness: The combination of all those reward neurochemicals and overflowing inspiration can be intoxicating.
- Richness: You can stay down too long, amazed at what you’re discovering.

The authors suggest us to balance ego inflation and time distortion, and don't get seduced by the sensations and information that arise in altered states. For example, Hans Ludwig has found an ecstasis substitute called “Burning Man”, she got the exact same feeling of extreme skiing. At that time, she realized that ecstasis can be accessed through a host of different pursuits, so she quit the sport, as she said, "saved my life".
