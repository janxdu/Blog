title: Be a shaper to shape your life

Recently a book named 'Principles: Life and Work', which is written by Bridgewater Associates's founder Ray Dalio, goes viral among Chinese folks. This book is about how he used some principles to lead himself to massive achievement, these principles are timeless and universal, giving some practical ways to manage life and work. I was obsessed by the formula he provided:
>Shaper = Visionary + Practical Thinker + Determined

The word 'shaper' depicts people who can go from visualization to actualization. Vision almost depends on clear goals. In that respect are some principles to set up goals that suits me: 
1. Don't confuse goals with desires.
2. Don't mistake the trapping of success for success itself.
3. Remember that great  expectations create great capabilities.
4. Knowing how to deal well with your setbacks is as important as knowing how to move forward.

To illustrate how I practice the methodology, let me take an example of my preparation for the TOEFL test. For me, to set up an appropriate goal of TOEFL test, I found my drawbacks through analysis performance of simulation test, asked for my friends's advices whom participated the test before. For each section in the test I assessed a rational point, which is a little higher that I thought I could attain, thereby I should engage myself more enthusiastically in preparation for the test.
To be a practical thinker, I need to identify and don't tolerate problems, diagnose problems to get at their root causes, and push plan to completion. These principles enchanted me:
1. Focus on the 'what is' before deciding 'what to do about it'.
2. Don't mistake a cause of a problem with the real problem.
3. Think of your plan as being like a movie script in that you visualize who will do what through time.
4. Write down your plan for everyone to see and to measure your progress against.
5. Establish clear metrics to make certain that you are following your plan.

I specify a periodic improvement plan with several milestones to indicate progress I got. To track daily stuffs, I used both handwritten and digital ways. Handwritten white board shows which level I achieved briefly, and Trello<sup>(1)</sup> board as a supplement mainly focuses on strategies in each section. Since Apple Watch became my mainly notification reminder, I set up the main panel to indicate how many days left before the TOEFL test, and daily tasks<sup>(2)</sup> to check in.

If set up specific goal, I realized I could easily concentrate on it and propel execution, which indicated I was  determined enough to accomplish the goal. 

There are more productive principles in this book, maybe I will share them someday.

----------------
(1): Trello is a web-based project management application.
(2): As Siri panel isn't available for third party applications, I used [workflow](https://www.workflow.is) to automatically import daily three important tasks from [gird diary](http://griddiaryapp.com/en/) to iOS reminder.
