It's worth taking 3.5h reading *The Little Book of  Productivity* by Scott H. Young, who finished MIT’s 4-year computer science curriculum without taking classes.
According to this book, I analysis my strategies in two parts: the strategies I used to overlook or mistake, and the strategies I already put in practice. I will only focus on the strategies I empathized with and integrate them, because there are many good ways to lead to productivity, which depend on different conditions. I should choose a relatively good enough way and take action, and make it my best practice. These parts are also in relation to other blogs and books I've read.
### The strategies I used to overlook or mistake
- Weekly/Daily goals
	- Listing tasks to finish in the next week at the end of each week.
	- Transferring some of the tasks from weekly list onto daily list at the end of each day.
	- Stoping working after completed daily tasks for that day(positive feedback of finishing means leisure).
- Simple Organizing System
	- Based on three parts
		- Projects
			- Primary goal, secondary goals
			- Meaning
			- Accomplishment
			- Arranging by how much it worth, other than how long it takes.
			- Setting a softly personal deadline ahead of the hardly official deadline.
		- Tasks
			- Dissolving in two parts, transforming things you should do into them
				- Want to do
				-  Not going to do
			- Specifying in a time-boxing.
			- Separating planning from doing.
			- Using brain actively in morning ritual.
			- The hardest first.
			- The ability to avoid hard work.
		- Events( which must be done at a certain time)
	-  List
		-  Things that have exponential payoffs.
		-  To-Stop List.
- Using a mantra
	- Always be a first-rate version of myself.

### The strategies I already put in practice
- Time-boxing, setting a timer and don't stop working on a task until I finish.
- Sprinting theory, encouraging myself to focus on the timeframe, then take a break.
- Be organized instead of tidy.
- Making an exercise Routine.
- Weekly/Daily reviews.
- Skeleton planning.
- Paying myself for work done, not time spent.
- 30-day trial, one habit at a time.
- To-Learn List.

### Productivity tools I use now
- Evernote(all platforms, easiest integrate with IFTTT and other services)
	-  monthly/weekly/daily review, plan
	-  To-Learn List, To-Stop List
- Pomotodo(all platforms)
	- time tracker
- Wunderlist(all platforms)
	- accidental events
- Due(iOS, easiest to reschedule)
	- ritual
- Monmentum(iOS, easiest to check-in)
	- habit tracker

### Review
- Combining convergent and divergent thinking at different stages. Daily tasks are only responsible for daily goals to concentrate on concrete objectives. And when it comes to review tasks, recharging motivation and removing hidden roadblocks by creative thinking. 
- Aware of positive feedback is not sustainable, so eliminating tasks to be completed. 
- Most autonomous yet appropriate, other than cater for others, avoid lazy people.
- Stopping doing specific job to avoid anxiety to review the meaning of the tasks and priority of them, choice is more important than effort.
- Combining robustness and serendipity, sometimes it needs disorder to let creativity emerged.

### Some Interesting Cases In Book
- Motivation catalysts
 	- A definition from high school chemistry: a catalyst is a chemical that speeds up a reaction, but doesn’t take place in the reaction itself.
 	- Methods
		- Making a public commitment.
		- post-it notes.
		- Keeping a list of goals.
- Parkinson’s Law suggests that, “Work will tend to expand to the time given”.
- Branch method, Rapid prototyping and fail Quickly from computer science.
