Scrum is a framework utilized to manipulate complex adaptive project, which is invented by Jeff Sutherland in 1990s. It presents a highly practical way to manage a team to achieve goals. It's easy to understand but hard to master. During the preparation of the TOEFL test, I accidentally used similar methods to boost my progress. To be more professional, I learned about some materials on Scrum, which helped me review the likelihood of achieving my goal, and made better strategies in subsequent periods.

### The Scrum team

A Scrum team typically contains these aspects:
- Roles: product owner, the development team and the scrum master.
- Number of people:3-7.
- Work time: for each member, no more than 40 hours a week.

### The heart of Scrum -- Sprint

I recall a champion in a marathon, who concluded how he won the game is by briefly marking some milestones on the path of the race before it started. Then when the race began, he ran as fast as he could to get to the first milestone, and kept moving forward to the next milestone, until running for the destination. He split up the total distance into small pieces, sprinted from one piece to another, and made each periodical destination visible and practical to achieve.
Sprint is also the heart in Scrum methodology, which can help a team keep track of projects. Scrum consists four aspects:
- Sprint Planning
A sprint is often planned last no more than a month, which defines requirements and specific goals. The strategies of getting target could be coordinated after starting, but the goal remains clear.
- Daily Scrum
The team needs to meet at a particular time daily, everyone should specify what have done yesterday, what to do today, and what are the pediments. 
- Sprint Review
At the end of a sprint, the team should inspect on what has done and hasn't done, as well as problems solved and unsolved.
- Sprint Retrospective
After sprint review, the team should summarize improvements and create a plan of the next sprint.

### My practice of Scrum

In preparation of the TOEFL test, I divided the goal into six sprints, in which four sprints correspond to the test's four parts and two extra sprints for enhancement.
For daily scrum, I choose tasks from "to do" list to "doing" list, at the end of the day, I move what have done to "done" list. Besides, I answer some vital questions with [GridDiary](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id597077261) <sup>(1)</sup> to find pediment and improvement.
