Self-control is the ability to regulate one's emotions, thoughts, and behavior in the face of temptations and impulses. As an executive function, self-control is a cognitive process that is necessary for regulating one's behavior to achieve specific goals.
Lately Weigang Wan explained a new book named "Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment" which provides a unique aspect to reflect self-control theory.

Traditionally, we describe self-control as reason prevailing over feelings. Like Plato invoked that the metaphor of a charioteer (the rational self) keeping horses (the unruly passions) under control. However, a new research investigates how people make decisions by scanning their brains. It turned out that researchers could do a good job of predicting whether someone would use money offered by researchers to purchase one of a series of things by watching which parts of the brain got active and which got inactive. And none of these were parts of the brain mainly associated with rational deliberation; Actually, they were parts related to feelings. For example, the nucleus accumbens and insula. People would be more likely to buy something if his nucleus accumbens became active and insula became inactive. This experiment suggests that the way the brain does the weighing is a contest of conflicting feelings, maybe reason can only by influencing the feelings to play a role in what a person finally does.
In this way, our decisions start with feelings and end with it.  Reason is a tool of feelings, which is the ultimate motivator. That means the key to self-control is to allocate feelings.
Considering you are about to eat chocolate, certain systems in your head were designed to be motivated to eat high-calorie foods and other systems associated with long-term health. Neither kind of module was more “rational” than the other, they just had different goals, and one was stronger than the other. Natural selection designed modules that get stronger with repeated success and it used gratification in one sense or another as its working definition of success. So the best way to self-control is to break the connection between the impulse and the reward. 
The author introduces a mindfulness meditation approach to overcoming addictions, which can describe as acronym "RAIN":
1. Recognize the feeling.
2. Accept the feeling (rather than try to drive it away).
3. Investigate the feeling and its relationship to your body from an outsider's point of view.
4. Non-attachment. You are not attached to this feeling.
