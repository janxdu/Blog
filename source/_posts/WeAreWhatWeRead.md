We can learn about a person by learning about the books he reads. When I view this opinion,  an advertisement about International Literacy day occurs to my mind, which shows how people are influenced by what they read. Obviously, reading is an essential part of our lives. We read news to get what happened recently, we read reports to collaborate with colleagues, moreover , we read books to construct ourselvesâ€™s mind and explore the world.
The genres of books we choose in some way reflect our preferences towards things. Technical books show how technology develops recently, and provide us a new aspect to understand the past and the future. Mental books help us look inside of ourselves, discover the instincts we have inside, construct our humanity. Imaginary books let us think of more possibilities in and beyond  our lives.
As the time goes, the books what we read gradually construct our personality, extend our points of the world. We can learn how to negotiate with people from game theory, we can improve out health condition relatively effective through correct postures to exercise, we may  do the right things corresponding to trends.
We are what we read, choose the books you are keen on and start reading, these will probably redefine ourselves and lead us to a brighter future.
